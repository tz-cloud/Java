Challenge 1:
Write a function spaces that accepts an integer N and returns a string with N spaces.
In the init function display the space with the work "DONE" concatentated at the end.

Challenge 2:
Write a function harmonic that accepts an integer N and return the sum of:
1/1 + 1/2 + 1/3 + ...+ 1/N


Challenge 3:
Approximate the function sine. Using the formule in Sine.PNG
Write a function sin that accepts the number of terms to sum and the degree in radiant (pi/6) and return the sum.

Challenge 4:
Write function fib where the function accepts a integer N and displays the first N fibinocci numbers. The sequence of numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,...

Example: N=6 , the function displays: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5


Challenge 5:
Create a function mTable that displays the multiplication table as shown in file MTable.png

HINT: Create a function nRow that can generate and display the numbers in a row. Use that function within a loop to generate all the rows.



Bonus  Challenge:

NCR (combination) formula is used to find the possible arrangements where selection is done without order consideration 

To calculate the combination of a set with N items being arranged in a grouping of R elements from the set:
nCr = N!/(R!(N-R)!)  (NOTE: N! is fact(N), the function you just wrote above).


Write a function nCr that accepts an integer N and R and returns the permuation. NOTE: Use the function fact from challenge 3 in this function. Test this function before moving on to the next function
    
Write a function biCoeff that accepts an integer N and displays the binomial coeffiecents for 
(A + B)^N expansion.  HINT: You do this by calling nCr function you wrote in a loop from 1 to N

Example: 
Look at BinomialExapansion.png
biCoeff(5) ==> 1 5 10 10 5 1
biCoeff(4) ==> 1 4 6 4 1
